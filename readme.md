This repository got inspiration and insightÂ on repository [deep_residual_unet](https://github.com/DuFanXin/deep_residual_unet) and paper [Efficient Multi-Class Semantic Segmentation of High Resolution Aerial Imagery with Dilated LinkNet](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8900281). The model mostly the same as Deep Residual U-Net, but on the bottleneck we added Dilated Block from Dilated LinkNet. The usage of Residual U-Net are for minimize the information loss on segmentation and Dilated Block are for bigger receptive field with minimum weights. For more detail on both architectures please check both papers [Road Extraction by Deep Residual U-Net](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.10684) and [Efficient Multi-Class Semantic Segmentation of High Resolution Aerial Imagery with Dilated LinkNet](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8900281).
